Creating a new column that changes the species names from the full name to the abbreviated version (e.g. Canis familiaris to C. familiaris)

```{r}
MData<-MData%>% mutate(Sp = gsub("(\\w)(\\w+)(\\W)","\\1\\. ", Species))
print(MData)
```
Creating a new dataset with Sp at the front and Species column removed

```{r}
NewData<-select(MData, Sp,Limb.Width:unitsL)
print(NewData)
```
